The project investigated the relationship between state minimum wage policies and children's mental health. This study was based on publicly available, deidentified data from the National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) for 2016-2022. The primary exposure variable was state minimum wage, measured in U.S. dollars, obtained from the U.S. Department of Labor. To assess mental health outcomes, I utilized 5 binary indicators: (1) depression, (2), anxiety, (3) ADD/ADHD, (4) behavioral problems, and (5) unmet mental health needs. I addressed two key research questions: (1) does the state minimum wage influence mental health outcomes among children and adolescents after accounting for spatial variation? and (2) do associations between state minimum wage and mental health outcomes differ across age and gender subgroups?
